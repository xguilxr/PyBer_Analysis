# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The objective of this analysis is to make a brief summary that describes the information of ride sharing behavior in different cities to make the most out of the data provided. This analysis extended to Urban, Suburban and Rural cities and using Pandas formulas calculations were made to acquire the values of total fares, total drivers, and average fares per ride to make a summarized graph that best shows the information. 

## Ride Sharing Behaviors

As its expected, rural cities have the least drivers and rides, suburban cities the second most and urban cities have the highest numbers of drivers, rides, and fares. Nonetheless, rural cities count with the highest proportion of fares per rides and drivers even though there are less drivers and rides. 

## Summary 

Firstly, try to handle the disparity between fare prices in rural cities to make it a little bit more accessible to people outside urban cities with larger capital possibilities. Try to make rural communities more accessible to rides and drivers. Invest in the suburban cities because here there is a lot of opportunity.
